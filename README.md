Our No. 1 Marvel Character **Iron Man (Tony Stark)'s Right Hand Virtual Partner ***J.A.R.I.S.***** J.A.R.I.S. is a desktop voice assistant which works on the voice command offered to it, it can do voice searching, voice-activated device control, and can let us complete a set of tasks. It makes it easier to complete any task as it automatically does it by using the essential module or libraries of Python, in a conversational interaction way. Hence any user when instructs on any task to it, because of the conversational interaction for giving input and getting the desired output in the form of a task done. The main application of it can be its multitasking ability. It can ask for continuous instructions one after the other until the user says “GO TO SLEEP” it.
